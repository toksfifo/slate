## iOS  SDK CocoaPod Integration

### Step 1: Install CocoaPods

Installing the SDK via the iOS [CocoaPod][apple_initial_setup_1] automates the majority of the installation process for you. Before beginning this process please ensure that you are using [Ruby version 2.0.0][apple_initial_setup_2] or greater. Don't worry, knowledge of Ruby syntax isn't necessary to install this SDK.

Simply run the following command to get started: `$ sudo gem install cocoapods

__Note__: If you are prompted to overwrite the `rake` executable please refer to the [Getting Started Directions on CocoaPods.org][apple_initial_setup_3] for further details.

__Note__: If you have issues regarding CocoaPods, please refer to the [CocoaPods Troubleshooting Guide][apple_initial_setup_25].

The {{include.platform}} Appboy SDK should be installed or updated using [CocoaPods][apple_initial_setup_1], a dependency manager for Objective-C and Swift projects. CocoaPods provides added simplicity for integration and updating.
